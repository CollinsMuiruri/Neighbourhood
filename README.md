It allows users to:
* Sign in with the application to start using it.

* Find a list of different businesses in their neighborhood.
* Find Contact Information for the health department and Police authorities near their neighborhood.
* Create Posts that will be visible to everyone in their neighborhood.
* Change one's neighborhood when they decide to move out.
* Only view details of a single neighborhood.

The following are needed for the application to run on a local computer:
* python3.6
* Django framework
* Bootstrap 3 or 4
* Text editor (atom, VS code or sublime text)
